"Hey. Hey, kid. You look cold."

"Don't bother, man. Ain't got shit, look at them."

It is cold. January is never the most pleasant climate, but today has been particularly bad. Almost like the world is trying to punish her. Further, that is.

"I am cold."

Only after the one man turns to stare at her does she realize she's spoken. It's hardly a full thought, but there isn't much else she might have wanted to say. 

"Listen, kid. You got money? Some cash? Don't take credit, heh."

The other guy snorts. "That joke is shit."

She feels around in her pocket. Yes, there's money in there. Not a lot. Just enough for a bus pass, or two. *Always keep enough money for a bus pass on you. You never know where you'll end up.*

"Like your face, fucker."

"Yes, I have money," she says. Something feels strange about her voice.
