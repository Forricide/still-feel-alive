"Hey. Hey, kid. You look cold."

"Don't bother, man. Ain't got shit, look at them."

It is cold. 

January is never the most pleasant climate, but today has been particularly bad. Almost like the world is trying to torment her. Further, that is.

"I am cold."

Only after the one man turns to stare at her does she realize she's spoken. It's hardly a full thought, but there isn't much else she might have wanted to say. 

"Listen, kid. You got money? Some cash? Don't take credit, heh."

The other guy snorts. "That joke is shit."

She feels around in her pocket. Yes, there's money in there. Not a lot. Just enough for a bus pass, or two. *Always keep enough money for a bus pass on you. You never know where you'll end up.* Who said that?

"Like your face, fucker."

"Yes, I have money," she says. Something feels strange about her voice. 

One of them snorts. 

"I got some of that good stuff, yeah?" The first man shows her a baggy. There's some sort of weird, well, something weird in it. She doesn't recognize it, but she can figure it out after a few seconds: drugs. For a moment, she feels a strange sense of pride. It's not the most difficult deduction ever, but anyone this tired would have a hard time figuring things out.

Or so she assumes. Hopes.

*If anyone ever offers you drugs, don't.* *It's life-ruining: I used to have a friend, Katherine, who got into drugs. I'm not sure what happened to her, but it wasn't good.*

A few memories fit together, after a fashion. They're wearing strange clothing and peddling drugs on the street: probably members of the Merchants, one of the city's gangs. She recalls learning about them in school. They were backed by a few parahumans, making them more dangerous than the average dealers, but still considered less of a threat than a fair number of gangs in the area.

What did that say about this city, anyways?

She shakes her head. "No, thank you." Habit.

The man offering her the baggy barks out a laugh.
