<p><i>What are you trying to accomplish?</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>"Survive."</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>That's it?</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>"I... I don't know what's going on. I don't have any control of my life. I'm scared in the morning, when I wake up, because I can't remember anything. I just want to make it long enough... to piece together something. Some sort of next step."</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>What would that look like?</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>"Having some sort of... purpose, maybe."</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>That seems a bit paradoxical.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>"Maybe. I just want to have a goal. Something to focus on."</i></p>

<p></p>

<p>Dreaming.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Always dreaming.</p>

<p></p>

<p>She opens her eyes, but isn't sure whether this is real life or another vision. The room is mundane enough; a bookshelf littered with miscellaneous trinkets, a plain chair pressed up against a pair of window curtains, her bed positioned directly across from the door. </p>

<p></p>

<p>At some point, she gets out of bed, gets dressed with clothes hidden in a dresser at the foot of the bed. They don't perfectly fit her, but she isn't particularly concerned with fashion. A mirror provides an unfortunate perspective. She attempts to fix her hair, but doesn't find much success.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"It is nice to meet you." </p>

<p></p>

<p>She ran into the man in the hallway. He's tall and- well, large. His appearance reminds her of something, like she should know who he is, but that knowledge is just a bit out of reach. Hopefully she'd recognize him if they'd met before; she tries to avoid staring at his translucent skin.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Hello." Is that an acceptable response? She isn't sure. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He doesn't seem to mind, just nodding and turning away. "Come with me. I will find you something to eat."</p>

<p></p>

<p>A lull in conversation allows her time to formulate a question. "What's next?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>They're sitting around a small table; Gregor is eating some kind of cereal, while Sarah seems to be considering a slice of toast. She puts it down to respond: "We'll need to get an idea of what your abilities are. If you're willing, we'll start on that within the next few days. Unless you'd like some more time to get adjusted?"</p>

<p></p>

<p><i>No.</i> "That's okay."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sarah looks at her a bit strangely. "Are you feeling all right? You look a little... paler than than you did on Monday."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Monday? She resists a slight urge to ask what day it is. "I'm fine."</p>

<p></p>

<p>She begins experimentation with Gregor a few hours later. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"What do you do?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>They're looking at, well, her. It's a bit strange looking at your own body from the third person. Not nearly as much like looking into a mirror as she would have expected.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The fact that the body was decomposing (abnormally fast, according to Gregor) probably had something to do with that. It smelled like death, but Sarah had said it might be useful, so they'd brought it with them to the 'training room'. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Coincidentally, Sarah had also declined to join them. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The training - if that was what it was - did not really go as planned. Although, she hadn't been privy to a plan of any sort in the first place, so she's still unsure of that. Mostly, it consisted of her and Gregor talking: he'd ask her a question about her experiences or what she was capable of; she'd think for a few seconds, never coming up with anything.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Okay. Are you all right if we move to another line of conversation?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p></p>

<p>He's brought her tea. It's very nice, better than the coffee that Sarah had made her try. A light hint of blueberry with some other fruit mixed in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"According to," he pauses. "Ah, Sarah. According to Sarah, you have said that you were previously on Earth Aleph?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>Earth Aleph?</p>

<p></p>

<p>Another Earth. An alternate dimension, a world broken into by - some mad scientist, a 'tinker', she recalls, just barely. Thinking about it, she does remember something, but it's just a hint. Nothing more than a faint semblance of a memory.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Gregor is looking at her expectantly. "I'm not sure."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"You do not know if you were in another dimension?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"No, I... I don't remember."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"This is inconvenient." He shifts his head, slightly. It's hard to tell if he's thinking, or just adjusting his neck. She tries to not stare too much at his skin. "Do you remember what your life was like prior to being here? Please excuse me if that is a personal question."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"I'm from here." A bay, Sarah had said. She can't quite recall the name, but she does remember that sense of familiarity. "I think."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"My question was unclear, I apologize. Do you remember your childhood? Your family?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>She looks at the dead copy of her body. Proof that she's a parahuman, someone <i>special</i>. It looks just like her, apparently; other than the pale skin and stench, it could be her identical twin.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It's only barely recognizable.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Gregor doesn't reply; instead, he contorts his body, twisting to display a mark on his skin. It's like a stylized 'C', except rotated ninety degrees counterclockwise. It looks like a tattoo, but she can't imagine why anyone would get one; while it's not particularly ugly, it doesn't look <i>nice</i> either, just a weird blemish on his - admittedly already weird - skin. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"Do you recognize this symbol?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Are you sure? Have you seen it anywhere on your body?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p></p>

<p>He shifts his body again, meeting her eyes. "This information may be important. Would you be all right with Sarah searching your body for this symbol? Your back?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>No. She doesn't say it out loud, but the thought makes her uncomfortable. It's hard to place a finger on why, exactly. But it's not something she wants to do, not now.</p>

<p></p>

<p>He seems to see her hesitation. "That was too personal. I am sorry. We can investigate this later, perhaps. When you are more comfortable with us."</p>

<p></p>

<p>She feels bad, for a moment. It's the first real thing anyone here has asked of her, and her reluctance feels like a strike against her. But then she realizes: "We could look at that."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Gregor follows her outstretched arm, pointing behind him towards the wall. <i>The copy.</i> "That is a good idea. Would you like to do that now? I can give you some privacy."</p>

<p></p>

<p>The smell was the worst part of that experience, psychological trauma coming in at a distant second. All, ultimately, for nothing: "No tattoo."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Nothing?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"This is all right." Gregor sits down on a bench. "It was just a hunch." </p>

<p></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Are you asking why I thought there might be a tattoo? Newter and I both have one. We are referred to as 'case fifty-threes', or by many, as monsters. Parahumans with physical deformities. And neither of us have any memories of our lives previous to being... like we are now."</p>

<p></p>

<p>He stops, looking at her. If there's any emotion involved in talking about such sensitive topics, it doesn't show.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"I don't have any... deformities. As you said."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Gregor nods. "And you do not have the tattoo, either. You are not one of us. I am sorry for presuming otherwise."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"It's okay. You thought that was the case, because I can't remember anything?" </p>

<p></p>

<p><i>Not</i> everything, a little voice in her head says. <i>There are still some memories left.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p>"Yes. It does not matter. I have more questions for you about your power."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, she has very few answers.</p>
