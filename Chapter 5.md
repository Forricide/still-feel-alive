"..."

"Do I know you?"

A good question. Unfortunately, she doesn't really know the answer. She feels like she's been asleep for weeks, months. Even once her eyes have adjusted to the light, she still doesn't recognize the girl.

"Are you all right?"

Sore throat, she rubs at it. After a few seconds, the girl offers her a half-full cup of water.

"Thank you," she says, with some effort. When she's ready again: "I don't think so."

The girl stares out the window.

It's beautiful outside. Her vantage point is poorer than the girl's, sitting across the room on a small chair, but she can still see the spring light illuminating a city outside. The buildings here are vibrant; it's not even the late afternoon, and yet it already has a distinct 'night life' aura.

"It's beautiful outside," she says, voice a little flat.

No response.

After a few minutes, the girl speaks again. "Who... are you?"

She doesn't answer.

Their conversation continues in a similar vein for what feels like hours. But it isn't boring; they share a melancholic peace, a sort of silent understanding.

*"Who are you?"*

The words are the same; their speaker, tone, is not.

A woman is standing in the doorway. For all that the girl exudes a calm apathy, this woman is vibrant, energetic. Her voice has a dangerous pitch to it, like a razor blade cuts off the ends of each syllable.

She's also holding a gun.

*This is interesting.* The first clear thought she's had in... well... a while, probably.
