"Do I know you?"

A good question. Unfortunately, she doesn't really know the answer. She feels like she's been asleep for weeks, months. Even once her eyes have adjusted to the light, she still doesn't recognize the girl.

"Are you all right?"

Sore throat, she rubs at it. After a few seconds, the girl offers her a half-full cup of water.

"Thank you," she says, with some effort. When she's ready again: "I don't think so."

The girl stares out the window.
