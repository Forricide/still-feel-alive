<p>The room is starting to smell.</p>

<p>She's not sure if the boy notices. He's excited, energetic. The lady in the screen is mostly gone, just reappearing to let her know when she can attack, and so it's up to the boy to find... packages for her. </p>

<p>"Hey, this one looks cool. What do you think? Okay, I'll take that as a yes. Says here... just press down on the little lever for three seconds."</p>

<p>"Welcome back, you okay? You were gone for... a while. Uh, anyways. What about this one? Might as well give it a shot."</p>

<p>"Okay, I think we're running out of the ones that look cool. But, um, speaking of looking cool, you don't really look so hot. Everything all right? You can stop whenever, and we'll go meet up with Faultline."</p>

<p>"...I don't think this is good, hey? How about this: One last one, and we'll leave. I don't even know if you can speak right now, and you've done a lot. Let's just... call it a wrap."</p>

<p>He looks around the room, then back at her, sitting on the floor. An inch of water is quickly soaking through her jeans. "For the last one, let's make it something good. Go out with a bang, am I right? ...yeah, okay. Dragon told me - you know, the tinker helping us out - that we weren't supposed to use <i>these</i> ones. Too much chance of, uh, friendly fire."</p>

<p>Peering at her, for a second. Then back to gesturing. "I guess, if we're doing one last one, she'll probably be fine. This one looks epic. What do you think it does?"</p>

<p>He's holding a device with several buttons dotting its surface. It looks almost out of a movie - a dark, metal core covered by switches and buttons and multicoloured wires. </p>

<p>"Wonder if it does several things, maybe. Like a multi-tool, except the settings are <i>boom</i>, <i>kaboom</i>, andâ€¦ Okay, that's too complicated for you, I'd imagine. Let's go for something a little simpler. How does this one look?"</p>

<p>No exposed wires. Just a single button, nearly flush with the white surface. Aesthetically pleasing, and completely different from the majority of the others. So much so, she wonders if it was perhaps made by someone else.</p>

<p>"Dragon, you there?"</p>

<p>It's a minute before the response. She doesn't even bother to show herself on the screen, speaking through a disembodied voice: "That is acceptable. It will detonate quickly; be careful. Go in two minutes." </p>

<p>"Okay. Hey, you hear that? T-minus two minutes." The boy pulls a phone out of his pocket. "I'll keep track. You, uh, prepare?"</p>

<p>He stares down at the phone, not looking around the room. She takes the chance to breathe.</p>

<p>The stench is overpowering.</p>

<p>Her head hurts. </p>

<p>She thinks of a woman she met, once. A businesswoman of some sort, or perhaps a lawyer. A role model. What would she say, if she saw all of this?</p>

<p>This...</p>

<p>This <i>monster</i>.</p>

<p>It stares at her, and she stares back, frozen. She can still smell that disgusting taste of death, lingering in her nose and sticking to the back of her throat. It fits this picture better than the last one.</p>

<p>The beast emanates danger. Just a moment ago, she was able to take it all in; now she only has fading impressions. But she remembers, remembers looking for the damage. Dozens of bombs, each more powerful than the last...</p>

<p>Nothing but superficial damage. Smalls spots where oily black blood oozes, and that's it.</p>

<p>It swipes a claw at her, and she wonders if the cape a few feet behind her has escaped. In the last moment, she presses down her thumb.</p>

<p>The Leviathan is stuck. </p>

<p>She can view its plight from every angle, see the water gushing down its back, inspect its flip-flopping fins. But what's important is its right hand - frozen in place, unmoving. It yanks its body back, to no avail. </p>

<p>The heroes charge.</p>

<p>This much motion is disorienting. She can view a large amount of information, but it's usually more static, like a picture. Two dozen superhumans levelling every ability they can bring to bear is enough for her to lose track of what exactly is happening.</p>

<p>The fight is over within a minute.</p>

<p>It's clear that the attackers aren't the cream of the crop. A few of them seem tougher than others, but a swipe from the Leviathan's free hand is enough to send most of them flying backwards. For a moment, it's not clear which ones are still maneuvering under their own control - then some right themselves, and others don't. A horrific scene. She finds it hard to feel emotional.</p>
