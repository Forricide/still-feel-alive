<p>"Hey. Hey, kid. You look cold."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Don't bother, man. Ain't got shit, look at them."</p>

<p></p>

<p>It is cold. </p>

<p></p>

<p>January is never the most pleasant climate, but today has been particularly bad. Almost like the world is trying to torment her. Further, that is.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"I am cold."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Only after the one man turns to stare at her does she realize she's spoken. It's hardly a full thought, but there isn't much else she might have wanted to say. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"Listen, kid. You got money? Some cash? Don't take credit, heh."</p>

<p></p>

<p>The other guy snorts. "That joke is shit."</p>

<p></p>

<p>She feels around in her pocket. Yes, there's money in there. Not a lot. Just enough for a bus pass, or two. <i>Always keep enough money for a bus pass on you. You never know where you'll end up.</i> Who said that?</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Like your face, fucker."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Yes, I have money," she says. Something feels strange about her voice. </p>

<p></p>

<p>One of them snorts. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"I got some of that good stuff, yeah?" The first man shows her a baggy. There's some sort of weird, well, something weird in it. She doesn't recognize it, but she can figure it out after a few seconds: drugs. For a moment, she feels a strange sense of pride. It's not the most difficult deduction ever, but anyone this tired would have a hard time figuring things out.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Or so she assumes. Hopes.</p>

<p></p>

<p><i>If anyone ever offers you drugs, don't.</i> <i>It's life-ruining: I used to have a friend, Katherine, who got into drugs. I'm not sure what happened to her, but it wasn't good.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p>A few memories fit together, after a fashion. They're wearing strange clothing and peddling drugs on the street: probably members of the Merchants, one of the city's gangs. She recalls learning about them in school. They were backed by a few parahumans, making them more dangerous than the average dealers, but still considered less of a threat than a fair number of gangs in the area.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What did that say about this city, anyways?</p>

<p></p>

<p>She shakes her head. "No, thank you." Habit.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The man offering her the baggy barks out a laugh. "Little shitter has manners, 'least. Should fuck off, though, y'know? Don't want to be in this part of town."</p>

<p></p>

<p>He's right, she doesn't. At this point, she doesn't want to be <i>anywhere</i> in this city. </p>

<p></p>

<p>After a few seconds of them staring at her, she leaves. It was <i>her</i> wall, but apparently 'two twenty-something gang members' had more right to it than 'one sophomore teenage girl (who was definitely there first)'.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The library is warm, and it's open until eight o'clock on weekdays. She doesn't really feel like reading, but the computers are useful, even if they take three minutes to log into. </p>

<p></p>

<p>By the time her session is up, she's sick of the news. It's just too <i>depressing</i>. There's so much in this city to worry about. Reading articles about gang wars or corruption in the recent election or drive-by shootings or deaths in schools or a surge in local Nazi recruitment is... almost enough to make her sick.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Even if she wasn't sick already, that is.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The librarians are giving her strange looks, so she retreats deeper into the library. There's a nice corner with a fresh newspaper, which is where she realizes her mistake: using the computer to read the news, leaving her with nothing to do when her hour was up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Well, she could read a book, of course. But it's hard enough to focus on a brief article. It's hard to imagine anything much longer going well.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At least the tabloids are interesting.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Apparently there's a new, stylish gang in town. The <i>Undersiders</i>. Nothing in the news about them, but apparently Johnny Idgetown knows something that other journalists don't. They're actually employed by Parian ("the local fashion-slash-cape guru, with plenty of financial capital to back a covert advertisement"), and she custom-made their costumes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The piece is accompanied by a photograph of the group. Shot from a window or something along those lines, it shows them riding gigantic monsters and trailing black smoke. Like the four horsemen, perhaps, but five, and less impressive.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Their clothing comes off more intimidating than it does compelling, but maybe that's what capes are looking for?</p>

<p></p>

<p>She wakes up to a light tap on the back.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"The library's closing."</p>

<p></p>

<p>The librarian meets her eyes as she straightens up. There's a bit of hesitation, there - she can't imagine what she looks like, right now - but they don't say anything.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Probably for the better.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The night is colder than the one before. </p>

<p></p>

<p>She hasn't slept much, recently. Spending nights wandering the city is <i>nice</i>, in a strange way. It's a different way of looking at the world, at her surroundings. </p>

<p></p>

<p>This night blends into day, sunlight illuminating the boardwalk.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It's nice to come here in the morning. Watching the sunrise is satisfying. It reminds her of better times, when things were good. When she had a family.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A family...</p>

<p></p>

<p>She finds an alleyway and lies down behind a dumpster. Although her hoodie covers them up, her cuts are still bleeding, and her stomach feels like it's twisted into a knot. It's still scarily easily to fall asleep.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Her mind is dark. Images of a dark limbo, some place that shouldn't exist but somehow does. There's no light, save for a few stars, the rest blotted out by <i>something</i>. Massive beings writhe in the corner of her eyes, but every time she turns to look, there's nothing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A long time passes, or a short time, not dreaming of anything, but still asleep.</p>

<p></p>

<p>She dreams of concepts, intangible things. Friendship, conveyed through whispered secrets and shared smiles; peace, from slow heartbeats and warm sunlight; home, an image of a regal woman with curled black hair.</p>
