Echoes whisper to her.

It's a unique music. Melody formed from silence, ringing noises that she isn't quite sure are real. A faint beat, pulsating, maybe the blood in her veins.

She opened her eyes, and now she's here. She doesn't particularly like it, lonely and dark and spacious, but she doesn't feel negative about it, either. Just... neutral. If this was *peace*, maybe it would be less of an ideal, and more of a purgatory.

There's something she's forgetting. It's coming back to her slowly, but still distant. She replays memories like a phone's voicemail: Her father, angry; the streets of Brockton Bay, gray and lifeless; Earth Aleph, friendly and calm. 

*Faultline's Crew.*

Faultline is Sarah's 'cape name' - she's more than a manager, she's the leader of the team of mercenary capes living in the upper floors of the dance club. Apparently Sarah isn't even her real name - she just uses it for safety, but it's too uncomfortable to change now.
