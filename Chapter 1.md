*Tired*.

The alarm isn't going off. She can't quite make out the digits, but it *looks* like 5:00. When was she going to get up, again?

Not at 5AM, that's for sure.

The shrill sound of glass breaking is more rousing than an alarm could ever be. It's not a bowl falling and shattering on the floor, but harsher. Violent.

And it's not enough to get out of bed at 5 in the morning. Not feeling like this, sore and aching from some faint memory of *something*. Not with this headache, feeling like the back of her skull was *split open*-

More glass breaking. Someone is yelling, but their voice is hoarse, too muffled to be comprehensible. Sunlight filters in through the blinds.

She closes her eyes. 

Everything hurts. Pain isn't a foreign sensation, but this is different. It's distant - phantom pains, faint but still there.

It's hard to get out of bed. It should be easier, given that she's already wearing her normal clothing, which isn't even wrinkled. Or how she'd been sleeping on top of the blanket. And yet, rolling off the bed and standing up is the most difficult thing she's done all day.

*And I'm just getting started.*

The light goes on before she opens the blinds; the light goes off a few seconds later. She doesn't remember being able to sleep in until 5 in the afternoon. Maybe *that* was the most difficult thing she'd done all day.

A quick glance at the calendar reveals that it's a school day. But there's no memory of that, not even a faint recollection -

*Why does it hurt so much?* Screaming.

School's not that important, anyways. What *is* important is figuring out what's going on. Everything is a little fuzzy, today, for some reason, but she's pretty sure that yelling and smashing things isn't normal.

It's a difficult decision, whether to run down the stairs or descend carefully, but 'awkward half-limp' is a suitable compromise. It's hard to tell which leg hurts more, so she gambles on left and stumbles a bit when her right freezes up.
