A flood of people.

There are no cars on the road. It's incredible how much *space* vehicles take up; now that they're almost entirely relegated to the side of the road, there is a surprising of space on the streets to maneuver. Considering, of course, that every single person in the entire city is outside.

She attempts to scan the mass of people. They're moving through the city fast, the armored van hardly waiting for people to get out of its way.

"Looking for someone?"

Newter is in the van with her. *"I'll keep you company, maybe help a bit with S n' R."* He doesn't look as calm as he sounds, repositioning himself every few seconds. Leaning forward, then back, then looking around the van.

"I'm not sure."

"Right, no memories. I get it."

Not quite true, but she doesn't correct him. It's quiet again, for a few seconds.

"I don't remember anything before I got powers," he says, not quite looking at her, "if you didn't know." 

She vaguely recalls Gregor explaining this. "And Gregor, right?"

"Yeah. Well, Shamrock too, actually. It's part of how we found her."

"I see."

He leans forward a little. "I get the difficulty. It's hard to... deal with not knowing. Where you're from, who you are, what your family was like. If you ever need to talk about it, after all this, uh, let me know."

"Okay." Then: "Thank you."
