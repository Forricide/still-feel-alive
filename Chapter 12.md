A flood of people.

There are no cars on the road. It's incredible how much *space* vehicles take up; now that they're almost entirely relegated to the side of the road, there is a surprising of space on the streets to maneuver. Considering, of course, that every single person in the entire city is outside.

She attempts to scan the mass of people. They're moving through the city fast, the armored van hardly waiting for people to get out of its way.

"Looking for someone?"

Newter is in the van with her. *"I'll keep you company, maybe help a bit with S n' R."* He doesn't look as calm as he sounds, repositioning himself every few seconds. Leaning forward, then back, then looking around the van.

"I'm not sure."

"Right, no memories. I get it."

Not quite true, but she doesn't correct him. It's quiet again, for a few seconds.

"I don't remember anything before I got powers," he says, not quite looking at her, "if you didn't know." 

She vaguely recalls Gregor explaining this. "And Gregor, right?"

"Yeah. Well, Shamrock too, actually. It's part of how we found her."

"I see."

He leans forward a little. "I get the difficulty. It's hard to... deal with not knowing. Where you're from, who you are, what your family was like. If you ever need to talk about it, after all this, uh, let me know."

"Okay." Then: "Thank you."

Nod.

It doesn't take long to reach the city's center.

There are more powerful people in one room than most people could meet in a lifetime. She doesn't recognize more than a small handful, but it's still somewhat intimidating. Men and women in violently-coloured costumes are talking animatedly. In the northern corner, a man with a gun almost as large as her body rests against a wall. Along the adjacent wall, gigantic four-legged monsters congregate around a girl with the visage of a dog as her face, scars along the length of her bare arms.

Overwhelming, to be so focused, when the people and sounds and smells are crushing her. She retreats, into herself. As deep as is safe.

"That's what we have. I need to ask again: Are you sure you want to do this?"

Another nod. She hardly remembers the first.

Who's talking?

A masked face in the screen. A metallic suit, vibrant colours. People in lab coats.

They're in a laboratory. Not the one that she pictures hazily in her mind; no sinks, no desks. Instead, pure-white counters, bizarre contraptions hanging from the ceiling, devices of every shape sitting underneath. The room is warm, but she shivers. 

"Okay. You're sure you understand what to do with the devices?"

In front of her, just a little behind the man in the metal suit, is an assortment of bombs. That's what they *said* they were, that is; she wouldn't have been able to tell them apart from any other device. Just wires and metal.

Dangerous.

"...We'll show you the trigger mechanism. When you use your ability to get next to the Endbringer, you'll depress it, then return here. Do you understand?"

She nods. 

It's uncomplicated.

Acceptable.

"All right." A note of concern. Not 'all right'. "When it reaches the city, we'll give you the first one."

"I can do it now."

"We don't know exactly where it is. The Leviathan moves fast - you'd have to predict his location, way ahead of time."

"That's fine."

This is where the armoured man speaks up. "You are a precognitive, along with being able to teleport?"

Precognitive. Isn't there someone on their team that has that power? She struggles to remember. "No. I can start looking for it."

The man's mouth - the only visible portion of his face - straightens, a tight line. "Okay. But do not detonate the package here, do you understand?"

A nod. Then, under his continued attention: "Yes."

"I think this one would be best. Dragon?"

"Agreed." It's short and has a clear button on top. The button doesn't really fit in; it's almost ugly compared to the rest of the device, and looks like it's not entirely attached. "You will need to be within ten feet of Leviathan for this one to have any effect. We'll need to make sure there aren't any capes nearby when you use it, though. I can keep track of that for you."

"Okay." She takes the bomb. It feels almost comfortable in her hand. "Newter?"

He holds out a hand, an ugly orange under the overpowered fluorescent lights.

The woman - Dragon? - starts to say something, but she's gone halfway through the sentence.
