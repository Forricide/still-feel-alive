There are more people in the room, now. 

Sarah was right, from a certain perspective. This group of people couldn't afford to stagnate, not in the high-paced world of capes. So they'd grown, as was necessary.

At one table, Newter and Gregor are playing some kind of card game. They'd tried to teach her, but it hadn't gone so well; she couldn't remember the rules now, anyways. Spitfire watches, hovering a comfortable distance away.

Labyrinth is in her room, resting. She can feel the girl in the back of her mind - no, not exactly her presence, but the world she's imagining. Like a distant headache, not painful, but noticeable.

Their most recent job brought them more than just money. The 'Azn Bad Boys' - a bizarre name for a terrifying local gang - had accrued a lot of international attention, especially in the past month. Playing a major part in taking them out had earned them a heavy increase in reputation; so much so that Sarah had been contacted by their newest recruit.

An all around success, even if the pay from the local Protectorate hadn't been particularly stellar. Even a week later, there was an air of celebration.

She's sitting at a table with Shamrock, their new recruit, and Sarah. A middle-aged woman sits to Sarah's left: a new, unpowered member of the- organization? Or were they still a *'crew'*?

That's a question for Sarah, perhaps. As the group expanded, it became more difficult to keep track of things. She'd made an effort over the past two days to cement things in her mind; it does seem easier to remember events, now.
