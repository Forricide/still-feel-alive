There are more people in the room, now. 

Sarah was right, from a certain perspective. This particular group of people couldn't afford to stagnate, not in the high-paced world of capes. So they'd sought out more members, parahuman or not, to round out their numbers.

At one table, Newter and Gregor are playing some kind of card game. They'd tried to teach her, but it hadn't gone so well. She can hardly remember the rules now, anyways. Spitfire is watching, hovering a comfortable distance away. 

Labyrinth is in her room, resting. She can feel the girl in the back of her mind - no, not exactly her presence, but the world she's imagining. Like a distant headache, not painful, but noticeable.

Their most recent job brought them more than just money. The 'Azn Bad Boys' - a bizarre name for a terrifying local gang - had accrued a lot of international attention, especially in the past month. Playing a major part in taking them out had earned them a considerable increase in reputation; so much so that Sarah had been contacted by their newest recruit.

An all around success, even if the pay from the local Protectorate hadn't been particularly stellar. Even a week later, there was an air of celebration.

She's sitting at a table with Shamrock, their new recruit, and Sarah. A middle-aged woman sits to Sarah's left: a new, unpowered member of the- organization? Or were they still a *'crew'*?

That's a question for Sarah, perhaps. As the group expanded, it became more difficult to keep track of things. She'd made an effort over the past two days to cement things in her mind; it does seem easier to remember events, now.

Sarah gets up from the table, suddenly. She watches as a huddle of sorts forms: Sarah and Gregor talking to each other, almost frantic; Newter hovering close by; Spitfire and Shamrock slightly farther back. They're only a few feet away, but she can't hear what they're saying, as any sound is drowned out by a loud alarm blaring in the background.

She covers her ears with her hands. Sarah is waving; she walks up.

They're saying things, talking animatedly. She tries to listen.

*leave the city*

*hopeless*

*reputation*

It takes a moment to realize her hands are still over her ears.

"Do you want to participate?"

"What's going on?"

Sarah shakes her head, sighs. "There's an Endbringer coming."

Vague recognition. "Okay."

"We have a sizeable team, but - none of us are particularly useful against him. No real damage, we'd just... well, it wouldn't go well."

"Okay."

"Except you - you can't die."

*I can't die.*

Even though she can think back - a month, now, maybe more, she doesn't remember *that*. Just... chasms of nothing, spotting her memory, bookending real-life experiences.

Sarah touches her shoulder. A surge of confidence. 

"What would I do?"

"That bomb tinker - *Bakuda.*" Everyone within earshot grimaces. "I'm thinking that they'll be trying to make use of some of her more exotic creations. You can get close to him, bring some with you, maybe. It's at least worth a shot."

Discussion quiets, if only a little.

"We won't force you, though."

Options, choices. 

*Endbringer*. There's a certain danger to the word, hanging around it like a wreath. Dripping. 

If she reaches deep, she can remember - a TV spot, Annette's apartment. *"Disaster has struck at Earth Bet's version of Australia, sources say. Allegedly, one of Bet's 'endbringers' - gargantuan, nearly invincible monsters - has laid waste to Canberra. Our resident"*

She gasps, suddenly, memory interrupted by a hand grasping her shoulder. 

"Are you all right?" Gregor, standing over her. "You were - ah, shaking."

If - if she could reach further, just a little bit, would she be able to remember? 

"I'll do it. I'll try."

"You sure?" Newter. "Those f-uh, things, they're really scary."

Sarah nods. "It's important you understand what this means. If you go out there to fight - well, do anything, really - near one of those monsters... anything can happen."

"No, it's... what you said, right?"

Sarah tilts her head, just a little. 

"I can't die."
