*Swimming in a sea of void, she's floating, just barely above the crest of the waves.*

*Nothing meets nothing, she gasps for breath.*

*The world is laid out before her. It is innumerable; a single instance would have already been uncountable, but she gazes into an infinitum, a planet folded in on itself over and over. A fractal, branches and trees all within the same spherical forest.*

*One stands out to her, another in the back of her mind.* 

*Where to go?*

*Something else makes the decision for her. Not a step, but a stumble; shoved forward into reality.*

She breathes in, deep - water.

Choking, thrashing.

A thousand pounds of ocean weigh down on her; she's crushed beneath it, can't move. Panicking. Drowning, metaphorically and literally.

*Where is this place?*

*Silence.*

*She feels the pull, again.*

*This time, she chooses where to go. Not consciously, nothing as simple as that, but there's an element of certainty in the eventual result.*

A woman screams. 

She's gasping for air, keeling over. It comes - so easily, blood rushing through her veins.

The most delicious breath she's ever taken. Not that she remembers many others.

"You- you're back."

Neither of them appear particularly calm; the woman's expression is still intermingled surprise and fear, and she's still breathing hard. Still: "...Yes."

"Listen, I-"

"Annette, honey, what's going on?"

"It's- this is that girl I told you about, Herb."

He squints. "The one that got run over?"

There's a pause. "It would seem so."

A brief sensation of pain shoots through her foot. She looks down. No useful information, other than the colour of her shoes.

"So you're a- what do they call them, again? Parahuman?"

They're gray. In the mediocre lighting, they almost blend in with the gray-brown plank flooring. It looks cold; she shivers.

"Maybe."

He snorts. "A bit non-committal, I get you. So you're, uh, here to visit?"

"Maybe."

The two adults look at each other. 

She frowns, just slightly. Wasn't there something she was supposed to be doing? She searches back -

*sinking pressure*

*choking*
