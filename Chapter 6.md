An intense woman, a lizard man, and a dead girl sit down for lunch.

There's a joke in here somewhere, but she can't quite quite figure it out.

The woman's name is Sarah. Or, rather, that's what she'd like to be called; the distinction seems somewhat pointless, but that isn't worth bringing up. The lizard-man (well, boy, really) is 'Neuter' - she wonders if his parents were high, or something. 

Another thing not worth bringing up.

Discussion is mostly pleasant. Sarah asks her if she likes the tea - she does, thank you. Neuter asks where she's from, which is a bit of a dead end. Sarah asks why a dead, decomposing copy of her body appears to be in one of their bedrooms. *This is also a dead end.*

She snorts. Sarah looks at her quizzically. "Sorry."
