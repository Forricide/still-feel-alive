An intense woman, a lizard man, and a dead girl sit down for lunch.

There's a joke in here somewhere, but she can't quite quite figure it out.

The woman's name is Sarah. Or, rather, that's what she'd like to be called; the distinction seems somewhat pointless, but that isn't worth bringing up. The lizard-man (well, boy, really) is 'Neuter' - she wonders if his parents were high when they named him. 

Another thing not worth bringing up.

Conversation is mostly pleasant. Sarah asks her if she likes the tea - she does, thank you. Neuter asks where she's from, which is a bit of a dead end. Sarah asks why a decomposing copy of her body appears to be in one of their bedrooms. *This is also a dead end.*

She snorts. Sarah gives her an odd look. 

"Sorry."

The information they provide during discussion is... interesting. Parahumans with weird or unusual powers are actually fairly common. As much as one might hear about invincible or super-strength or flight-capable capes in the news, there are plenty of powered individuals who apparently have utterly bizarre powers. Newter ("I picked my name because I'm kind of like a newt, actually." "Oh, really?") secretes an incredibly potent hallucinogen through his skin. He says it has its uses both in combat and recreationally, although the idea of the latter is somewhat unpleasant to her.

Sarah can split things that she touches. Considerably more impressive, especially when she demonstrates. 

"Can I show off, too?"

"No."

"But -"

"No drugging the guest, Newter."
