In her dreams, she sits at a table, talking. She's accompanied by a man and a woman: her father, quiet but friendly; Annette, talkative and empathetic. Both of them adults, are yet the discussion is almost laughably juvenile, light, changing subjects constantly.

She gets the feeling it isn't really her, that she's just along for the ride. That it's a strange clone of her that's sitting there and chatting. Enjoying life.

Enjoying life?

She wants to enjoy life, too. What is that saying? 'Stop and smell the roses.' *I want to find the roses.* 

A silly thought. 

Her father says something: Annette laughs, she giggles. It's a bittersweet music. A song she hasn't heard in a long, long time.

She remembers her mother to be dead. Her father... gone, perhaps, in a different sense of the word. This scene makes her lonely, but they're both worlds away. Distanced in so many more ways than one. 

*I want to make new friends.*

New relationships, new opportunities, new life.

She pictures those more recent memories in her mind. Dreamlike, the scene changes. Talking with Sarah over tea, discussing parahumans and powers with Gregor. Slowly experimenting, safe and easy ideas slowly becoming more radical.

They're far away, too. But she can remember more. Being here before, dreaming, imagining. 

Waking up.

*"She's not breathing, she's not breathing!"*

*"Do you think that I should call an ambulance?"*

"Calm down, Newter. Gregor, not yet."
