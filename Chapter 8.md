In her dreams, she sits at a table, talking. She's accompanied by a man and a woman: her father, quiet but friendly; Annette, talkative and empathetic. Both of them adults, are yet the discussion is almost laughably juvenile, light, changing subjects constantly.

She gets the feeling it isn't really her, that she's just along for the ride. That it's a strange clone of her that's sitting there and chatting. Enjoying life.

Enjoying life?

She wants to enjoy life, too. What is that saying? 'Stop and smell the roses.' *I want to find the roses.* 

A silly thought. 

Her father says something; Annette laughs, she giggles. It's a bittersweet music. A song she hasn't heard in a long, long time.
