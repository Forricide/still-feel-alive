<p><i>Swimming in a sea of void, she's floating, just barely above the crest of the waves.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>Nothing meets emptiness. She gasps for breath. There's nowhere to surface; it's the same above and below.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>The world is laid out before her. It is innumerable; a single instance would have already been uncountable, but she gazes into an infinitum, a planet folded in on itself over and over. A fractal, branches and trees all within the same spherical forest.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>One stands out to her, another in the back of her mind.</i> </p>

<p></p>

<p><i>Where to go?</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>She waits, takes her time. Sinking, but slowly, not falling but fading.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>Impatient, something else makes the decision for her. Not a step, but a stumble; shoved awkwardly forward into reality.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p>She breathes in, deeply: Water.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choking, thrashing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A thousand pounds of ocean weigh down on her; she's crushed beneath the pressure, can't move. Panicking. Drowning, metaphorically and literally.</p>

<p></p>

<p><i>Where is this place?</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>Where am -</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>Where am</i> <b><i>I?</i></b></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>She feels the pull, again. Almost beckoning to her. Something beyond this vast emptiness, calling to her.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>This time, she chooses where to go. Not consciously, nothing as simple as that, but there's an element of certainty in the eventual result.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p>A woman screams. </p>

<p></p>

<p>She's gasping for air, keeling over. It comes - so easily, blood rushing through her veins. Coughing, expecting water from her lungs, finding only air.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The most delicious breath she's ever taken. Not that she remembers many others.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"It's- You- you're back."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Neither of them appear particularly calm; the woman's expression is still intermingled surprise and fear, and she's still breathing hard. Still, the answer is easy: "Yes."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Listen, I-"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Annette, honey, what's going on?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"It's- this is that girl I told you about, Herb." Only a few seconds have passed, but she's already composed, crossing her arms. A brief flare of recognition, quickly subsiding.</p>

<p></p>

<p>He squints. "The one that got run over?" Not skeptical, but something close. Worried, perhaps, but he's an unfamiliar face, even more than the woman.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There's a pause. "It would seem so."</p>

<p></p>

<p>A brief sensation of pain shoots through her foot. She looks down. No useful information, other than the colour of her shoes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"So you're a- what do they call them, again? Parahuman?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>They're gray. In the mediocre lighting, they almost blend in with the gray-brown plank flooring. It looks cold; she shivers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p></p>

<p>He snorts. "A bit non-committal, I get you. So you're, uh, here to visit?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p></p>

<p>The two adults look at each other. </p>

<p></p>

<p>She frowns, just slightly. Wasn't there something she was supposed to be doing? She searches back -</p>

<p></p>

<p><i>sinking pressure</i></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>choking</i></p>

<p></p>

<p>"Are you okay? Hey, say something!"</p>

<p></p>

<p>Her knees press against the cold floor. Wood buckles, a small amount, under their weight. A spark of a headache shoots through her head. The floor looks cold, is cold, permeating through her dark blue jeans. Blue on gray-brown, distant light providing pale shadow. She shivers uncontrollably.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"What do I do? Anne, do I need to call someone? An ambulance?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"No, I think - she's fine. Can you get her something to drink?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>Water swishes back and forth. Miniature waves. Sound waves, too. Back and forth, side to side.</p>

<p></p>

<p>She drinks. Breathes deeply.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And then she's choking again, spasming, hunched over the ground.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For a moment, she'd wanted to be here. Faltered, just barely. Is this her punishment?</p>

<p></p>

<p>The woman's voice is raised. The man has a hand on her shoulder-</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then she's in the void again, alone. Her ears seem to ring for a moment; it fades, and she remembers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For once, she makes a conscious decision to stay longer. Not that long - not that she could keep track of time either way - but long enough to think over things. She <i>peruses</i> her memory, indexes it, analyzes. </p>

<p></p>

<p>A decision: Parahuman powers make some things easier. Making money, forming relationships of a sort. <i>dying, pain, despair</i> Other things, it makes more difficult. Living a long life, especially. <i>distanced from society, hopeless</i></p>

<p></p>

<p>If she's immortal - well, nothing lives forever. But if she can't die in a regular sense, then there's no reason to avoid it. <i>this can't be right</i></p>

<p></p>

<p>She hears faint whispers, a voice - in her mind, perhaps, but is there anything here other than her mind? Counsels patience, safety. Inaction, passivity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For a moment, she listens. Then ignores it, easily given the volume.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Hey, Sarah."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Shock, surprise.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Her mind begins to fade. "I'm sorry about disappearing on you. Can you-"</p>

<p></p>

<p>The next sentence is already gone, if she ever planned it at all. She can't think of anything to say.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"It's okay. I understand. Powers can be hard to work with."</p>

<p></p>

<p>A nod.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Why don't you go and rest? If you think you've got a bit of a better hold of what you can do, now, perhaps we can test some things out tomorrow."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Two weeks later, the apocalypse comes.</p>
