A world away, she is dreaming.

Deep breaths make a foggy backdrop to calm observation. 

It's both the greatest thing she's ever seen, and the most limited. A hundred thousand million earths, spiraling out from one another, yet all at the same fixed position. There is nothing beyond this in her sight: no moon, no sun, no stars. Just an uncountable number of a single, lonely planet.

*We're so alone, aren't we?*

Somehow, she feels something agreeing with her.

No matter. The *payload* is heavy in her right hand. Some piece of metal juts out into her palm; a pinprick of almost-pain spreads out. She clenches it tighter, not knowing what would happen if she dropped it here. There's no gravity, so it wouldn't fall anywhere, or so she would assume. And yet...

Maybe there *was* gravity, and it would fall towards the conglomeration of Earths.
