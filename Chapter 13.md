A world away, she is dreaming.

Deep breaths make a foggy backdrop to calm observation. 

It's both the greatest thing she's ever seen, and the most limited. A hundred thousand million earths, spiraling out from one another, yet all at the same fixed position. There is nothing beyond this in her sight: no moon, no sun, no stars. Just an uncountable number of a single, lonely planet.

*We're so alone, aren't we?*

Somehow, she feels something agreeing with her.

No matter. The *payload* is heavy in her right hand. Some piece of metal juts out into her palm; a pinprick of almost-pain spreads out. She clenches it tighter, not knowing what would happen if she dropped it here. There's no gravity, so it wouldn't fall anywhere, or so she would assume. And yet...

Maybe there *was* gravity, and it would fall towards the conglomeration of Earths. At that thought, suddenly she's closer. Where before the planet was the size of her hand, now it takes up her full field of view. Just the single instance, the one she wanted.

She can see the Leviathan. A black shape, gigantic, cutting through the Atlantic ocean. The picture is perfect, clear - enough to see the blood trailing through the water, the aquatic corpses left in the beast's wake.

Her mind feels clearer, too. It's hard for her to know if this is what *normal* is supposed to be, or if this place somehow lets her think easier than even before she... had these powers.

Slight shudder. Here, the memories come back easier. It had been useful, at first... but also a liability.

There are more important things to think about.

Her vision sharpens. The beast, the *Leviathan*, has almost reached the city. It carves through the water, a straight line, ignorant or uncaring of obstacles in its path.

She presses down her thumb, hard. Then she joins him in the water, even as she can feel the device expanding.

"That was fast. Do you think you got him with it?" A woman's face, overlarge, tilts to the left. "You didn't even take the original with you. That could be big, given our limited supply."

"Hey, you okay?" A familiar voice.

Nod.

"Are you... is that a side effect of your power?"

"We don't know yet, actually. She's... new to the team."

"I see. Do you think she'll be okay to do that again, or..?"

The armored man is gone, leaving just the boy in the room with her. He's looking at her with some kind of concern, brow furrowed, tail low. "I think she's okay. Hey, do you want to do that again?"

No.

Nod.

"Okay. What were you saying we should use, Dragon?"

"Hold on. Leviathan's been sighted, I'm going to verify if the last one visibly hit. If she was able to connect with that, we might want to go with something with more... ah, 'oomph'."
