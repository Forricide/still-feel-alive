Sleeping under the stars is a nice experience. It's the trifecta of wilderness: the cold, that bitter chill; the dim, spotty light; the dry air, crisp in your lungs. There's an argument that could be made that it's better to sleep outside sometimes, if not for the sake of comfort, then for the pursuit of good health. 

Taylor would find it difficult to make that argument, right now. *This couch is amazing*.

She's not even sure whose couch it is. But that doesn't matter, because it's *warm*, it's soft, it's... well, it's actually a fairly mediocre piece of furniture. An almost decorative couch, nicer in appearance than in comfort. It still, of course, beats cold asphalt behind a dumpster any day.

If she slept, here, she doesn't remember. The last... days? week? is foggy, but at least she feels rested now. Like a weight's been lifted off her shoulders.

Inhale, exhale.

Peace.

She gets up from the couch and looks around. A small painting hangs from one wall. In the middle is a quote: *I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.* Its background is a blurred face, greyscale, regal. 

The couch below it, across from the one she was sleeping on, looks expensive but unused. In fact, the entire room - an apartment, it seems - hardly gives off the feeling of being lived in. *It's so clean*. It's not even decorated; other than the single painting, the walls are bare, and even the miniature kitchen counter has nothing on it.

It doesn't take her too long to decide what to do. She's not sure how she ended up here; maybe someone took her in, maybe she found a place to stay last night (*last night?*). Maybe the vague memories of pain and cold and emptiness are just... were just dreams, products of a restless sleep.

Regardless, she's starving, and the kitchenette seems to be a perfect solution. 

Her stomach grumbling, she dives into the fridge, and-

Well, the fridge isn't that different from the rest of the apartment, unfortunately. It's nice, and so is the kitchen, but clean and hardly used. Only a few eggs are left in a carton; they expired last week, and so did the premade salad, the cheese, and the package of sliced meat.

Thankfully, there's bread in the freezer.

While it's toasting, she goes to open the blinds. The view is absolutely stunning, a picturesque American city that she hadn't thought could exist. Maybe it's just the angle (or the full night's rest), but there's just something beautiful about it, the way the early morning sunlight illuminates shining glass skyscrapers pointing out amidst a sprawling city.

It almost reminds her of a picture she saw once, a place someone had wanted to go -

"Who are you? And *what* are you doing in my apartment?"

*Shit*. "Uh, hi!" she says, turning, "Sorry - I'm not sure why I'm here, either, do I know y-"

Then it hits her. And then she knows, she feels that all-too-familiar dread: she's still sleeping. She's dreaming, because this could never be real, would never happen.

She blurts it out, anyways.

"Mom?"

A quirk of her eyebrow. "I don't think so. And I'm going to need an explanation, or I'm calling the cops."

"I- you look so much like her." A swallow. Silence, for a moment, and she can hear her heart beating. "But you're, she's, dead."

The woman's expression seems to waver between sympathy and amusement. "I feel rather alive, thank you very much. But I *am* running out of patience."

Patience. Something she's almost forgotten about, taking life as she has recently. It's so easy to just let the world flow around you. 

"I'm, I'm Taylor. And I'm not sure why I'm here... I don't remember anything." *Bitter cold. Darkness, hiding something. Hunger*. *Always hungry.*

It's quiet, and then: *pop*. They're both startled, until Taylor realizes the toast is ready.

"I, uh. I made toast. Are you sure you don't know why I'm here?"

"No, why would I - okay." The woman sighs. "Take the toast, sit down. Let me think for a minute."

Taylor complies. The toast is good - warm, crisp. Also: edible. She watches as the lady, so similar to her mother, checks something at the door. An alarm of some sort, and it looks *new*, just like the rest of the apartment. Practically shiny.

"Okay. I don't know who you are," she says as she returns, sitting down at the table. "But I believe you. You don't look... all right. Why don't you tell me what you remember?"

*Cold, tired, aching.* "I... I'm not sure. I was outside, but I don't really remember why. And... my father, he, he..." 

*Was that really dad?*

Waking up in her room - her room? - and her own father not recognizing her, then so soon after, this? It was a nightmare. It had to be. 

"I don't know. I don't know what's going on, and it's scary. I keep waking up and not remembering anything. Like, like I've been drugged. And now you, you look so much like my mom did, back when she - am I dreaming? I don't understand."

The lady's mouth morphs into a frown. "That doesn't sound okay. Where do you live?"

Where? It takes her a second. "Southwest of the Docks."

"The... docks? I don't think we have those, here."

She recognizes that name, from reading the news the other day. But it wasn't a political piece, because to the author, he wasn't a politician - but an insight, a shallow vision into another world.

Another Earth.

She's farther away from home than she'd thought.
