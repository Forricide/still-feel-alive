Sleeping under the stars is a nice experience. It's a trifecta of wilderness: the cold; the dim, spotty lights; the dry air. There's an argument to be made that it's better than sleeping inside, if not for the sake of comfort, then for the pursuit of good health.

Taylor would find it difficult to make that argument, right now. *This couch is amazing*.

She's not even sure whose couch it is. But that doesn't matter, because it's *warm*, it's soft, it's... well, it's actually a fairly mediocre piece of furniture. A fairly mediocre piece of furniture that beats cold asphalt behind a dumpster any day.
