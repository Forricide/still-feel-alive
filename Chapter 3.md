Sleeping under the stars is a nice experience. It's a trifecta of wilderness: the cold; the dim, spotty lights; the dry air. There's an argument to be made that it's better than sleeping inside, if not for the sake of comfort, then for the pursuit of good health.

Taylor would find it difficult to make that argument, right now. *This couch is amazing*.

She's not even sure whose couch it is. But that doesn't matter, because it's *warm*, it's soft, it's... well, it's actually a fairly mediocre piece of furniture. A fairly mediocre piece of furniture that beats cold asphalt behind a dumpster any day.

If she slept, here, she doesn't remember. The last... days? week? is foggy, but at least she feels rested now. Like a weight's been lifted off her shoulders.

Inhale, exhale.

Peace.

She gets up from the couch and looks around. A small painting covers one wall, in the middle is a quote: *I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.* Its background is a shadowy face, greyscale, regal. 

The couch below it, across from the one she was sleeping on, looks comfortable but unused. In fact, the entire room - an apartment, it seems - hardly gives off the feeling of being lived in. *It's so clean*.

It doesn't take her too long to decide what to do. She's not sure how she ended up here; maybe someone took her in, maybe she found a place to stay last night (*last night?*). Maybe the vague memories of pain and cold and emptiness are just... were just dreams, products of a restless sleep.

Regardless, she's starving, and the kitchenette seems to be a perfect solution.
