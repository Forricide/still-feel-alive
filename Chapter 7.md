*What are you trying to accomplish?*

*"Survive."*

*That's it?*

*"I... I don't know what's going on. I don't have any control of my life. I'm scared in the morning, when I wake up, because I can't remember anything. I just want to make it long enough... to piece together something. Some sort of next step."*

*What would that look like?*

*"Having some sort of... purpose, maybe."*

*That seems a bit paradoxical.*

*"Maybe. I just want to have a goal. Something to focus on."*

Dreaming.

Always dreaming.

She opens her eyes, but isn't sure whether this is real life or another vision. The room is mundane enough; a bookshelf littered with miscellaneous trinkets, a plain chair pressed up against a pair of window curtains, her bed positioned directly across from the door. 

At some point, she gets out of bed, gets dressed with clothes hidden in a dresser at the foot of the bed. They don't perfectly fit her, but she isn't particularly concerned with fashion. A mirror provides an unfortunate perspective. She attempts to fix her hair, but doesn't find much success.

"It is nice to meet you." 

She ran into the man in the hallway. He's tall and- well, large. His appearance reminds her of something, like she should know who he is, but that knowledge is just a bit out of reach. Hopefully she'd recognize him if they'd met before; she tries to avoid staring at his translucent skin.

"Hello." Is that an acceptable response? She isn't sure. 

He doesn't seem to mind, just nodding and turning away. "Come with me. I will find you something to eat."

A lull in conversation allows her time to formulate a question. "What's next?"

They're sitting around a small table; Gregor is eating some kind of cereal, while Sarah seems to be considering a slice of toast. She puts it down to respond: "We'll need to get an idea of what your abilities are. If you're willing, we'll start on that within the next few days. Unless you'd like some more time to get adjusted?"

*No.* "That's okay."

Sarah looks at her a bit strangely. "Are you feeling all right? You look a little... paler than than you did on Monday."

Monday? She resists a slight urge to ask what day it is. "I'm fine."

She begins experimentation with Gregor a few hours later. 

"What do you do?"

They're looking at, well, her. It's a bit strange looking at your own body from the third person. Not nearly as much like looking into a mirror as she would have expected.

The fact that the body was decomposing (abnormally fast, according to Gregor) probably had something to do with that. It smelled like death, but Sarah had said it might be useful, so they'd brought it with them to the 'training room'. 

Coincidentally, Sarah had also declined to join them. 

The training - if that was what it was - did not really go as planned. Although, she hadn't been privy to a plan of any sort in the first place, so she's still unsure of that. Mostly, it consisted of her and Gregor talking: he'd ask her a question about her experiences or what she was capable of; she'd think for a few seconds, never coming up with anything.

He had been wondering about her time on Earth Aleph? ok check this zz
