*What are you trying to accomplish?*

*"Survive."*

*That's it?*

*"I... I don't know what's going on. I don't have any control of my life. I'm scared in the morning, when I wake up, because I can't remember anything. I just want to make it long enough... to piece together something. Some sort of next step."*

*What would that look like?*

*"Having some sort of... purpose, maybe."*

*That seems a bit paradoxical.*

*"Maybe. I just want to have a goal. Something to focus on."*

Dreaming.

Always dreaming.

She opens her eyes, but isn't sure whether this is real life or another vision. The room is mundane enough; a bookshelf littered with miscellaneous trinkets, a plain chair pressed up against a pair of window curtains, her bed positioned directly across from the door. 

At some point, she gets out of bed, gets dressed with clothes hidden in a dresser at the foot of the bed. They don't perfectly fit her, but she isn't particularly concerned with fashion. A mirror provides an unfortunate perspective. She attempts to fix her hair, but doesn't find much success.

"It is nice to meet you." 

She ran into the man in the hallway. He's tall and- well, large. His appearance reminds her of something, like she should know who he is, but that knowledge is just a bit out of reach. Hopefully she'd recognize him if they'd met before; she tries to avoid staring at his translucent skin.

"Hello." Is that an acceptable response? She isn't sure. 

He doesn't seem to mind, just nodding and turning away. "Come with me. I will find you something to eat."

A lull in conversation allows her time to formulate a question. "What's next?"

They're sitting around a small table; Gregor is eating some kind of cereal, while Sarah seems to be considering a slice of toast. She puts it down to respond: "We'll need to get an idea of what your abilities are. If you're willing, we'll start on that within the next few days. Unless you'd like some more time to get adjusted?"
