Annette is a good host, far more than Taylor deserves. The woman isn't around much, only living in the apartment temporarily while she's the attorney for a large case. She's still fine with Taylor staying there while she's gone, even picking up food while she's out. 

When they're both in the suite, she regales Taylor with stories about her job. Never anything about the Current Case (which is sometimes mentioned in vague, yet concerning ways), but instead different tidbits about strange clients or cases she's had in the past. Conversation is fun and easy; she feels like the mother Taylor never had. Or had at one point, maybe, but those are very distant memories.

It's a kindness that Taylor worries she'll never repay in full. Every day it gets a little bit easier to wake up, yet her mind feels more clouded every morning than the last. At one point, Annette brings her a few drugs; despite feeling a little obligated, she doesn't take any. Something about them brings up bad feelings.

"So, what's it like, living around so many parahumans?"

She considers the question. It's hard to form an opinion when she barely remembers what her city looked like. "Dangerous."

"Hm. Not enough heroes?"

"It's ... even they pose a danger. Heroes, villains, they're both sort of dangerous to your health as a civilian. The least dangerous ones are probably the mercenaries."

"Really?"

"Yeah. They're not as active, just do what they're paid for, I guess. Less likely to be blowing up a city block or something like that. There's one group in the city I lived in..." She thinks for a minute, "Faultline's Crew. A couple of mercenaries, maybe five? But I don't think they were related to that many - if any - civilian deaths. At least, not in my city."

"I see. Sounds like there's not that much control."

She nodded. It was true; from what Taylor could remember, even the city's resident mercenary group had been a sort of rarity, far calmer and less active than the norm.

This world was different. There was no fear of your house being leveled by a flying war machine; you were never late to work because a gigantic metal wolf was rampaging through the street. 

When their conversation veered in that direction, Taylor said she preferred it here. Earth Aleph, where it was peaceful, less violent. So similar to her home, yet so different.

She didn't mention that she wished every night she could go back. Not to her family; she couldn't remember them. Not to her home; that place was tainted with bad experiences. But she wished she could be back in her home city, so that maybe she could remember something, again.

...of course, finding her father again would probably help, as well.
