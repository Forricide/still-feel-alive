Annette is a good host, far more than she deserves. The woman isn't around much, only living in the apartment temporarily while she's the attorney for a large case. She's still fine with Taylor staying there while she's gone, even picking up food on her way back. 

It's a kindness that Taylor feels she'll never repay in full.
