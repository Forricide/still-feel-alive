Annette is a good host, far more than Taylor deserves. The woman isn't around much, only living in the apartment temporarily while she's the attorney for a large case. She's still fine with Taylor staying there while she's gone, even picking up food while she's out. 

When they're both in the suite, she regales Taylor with stories about her job. Never anything about the Current Case (which is sometimes mentioned in vague, yet concerning ways), but instead different tidbits about strange clients or cases she's had in the past. Conversation is fun and easy; she feels like the mother Taylor never had. Or had at one point, maybe, but those are very distant memories.

It's a kindness that Taylor worries she'll never repay in full. Every day it gets a little bit easier to wake up, yet her mind feels more clouded every morning than the last. At one point, Annette brings her a few drugs; despite feeling a little obligated, she doesn't take any. Something about them brings up bad feelings.

"So, what's it like, living around so many parahumans?"

She considers the question. It's hard to form an opinion when she barely remembers what her city looked like. "Dangerous."

"Hm. Not enough heroes?"

"It's ... even they pose a danger. Heroes, villains, they're both sort of dangerous to your health as a civilian. The least dangerous ones are probably the mercenaries."

"Really?"

"Yeah. They're not as active, just do what they're paid for, I guess. Less likely to be blowing up a city block or something like that. There's one group in the city I lived in..." She thinks for a minute, "Faultline's Crew. A couple of mercenaries, maybe five? But I don't think they were related to that many - if any - civilian deaths. At least, not in my city."

"I see. Sounds like there's not that much control."
